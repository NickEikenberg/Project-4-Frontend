### About the App
*"Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance" -Eckhart Tolle*

In a world so intently focused on the negativities, we aimed to create an app designed to document the highlights of our day and thus giving more life and gratitude to the simple acts of human kindness and coincidences that make life worth living. Visit our app and record one good thing (or more!) that made you pause and smile for the day or peruse others' submissions to remind you of the better things. 

### Did You Know...? Benefits of Recording Gratitude...
***
* Lower stress levels
* Feel calmer at night
* Gaining a new perspective and appreciation for your life's occurences
* Gain clarity on what matters most to you and what to cut from your current routine
* Increases self-awareness
* Nice to look back at on days you feel low as a reminder of how far you've come and how far you've yet to go!

*"Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clairty. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend." -Melody Beattie*
